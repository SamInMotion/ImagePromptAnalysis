# Chatlog Analysis with Python

This project analyzes chatlog data extracted from an HTML file. It utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NetworkX, and WordCloud for data manipulation, visualization, and network analysis.

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook file (`chatlog_analysis.ipynb`) contains the following analyses and visualizations:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: The notebook starts by loading the chatlog data from a CSV file and displaying the first few rows to inspect the structure.

2. Image URL Distribution: It visualizes the distribution of messages with and without image URLs using a pie chart.

3. Word Cloud Visualization: A word cloud is generated to visualize the most common words used in the message prompts after filtering out stopwords.

4. Mention Network Graph: A mention network graph is created using NetworkX to visualize the connections between users based on mentions in the messages.

5. Hourly Message Analysis: Messages are resampled by hour and plotted to analyze the hourly message activity.

6. Word Frequency Analysis: The frequency of the most common words used in the message prompts is analyzed and visualized using a bar plot.

7. Top Mentioned Users: The top 10 most mentioned users in the chatlog are identified and plotted.

## Usage

To use this notebook:

1. Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NetworkX, WordCloud).
2. Download the chatlog data in CSV format.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`chatlog_analysis.ipynb`) in your Jupyter environment.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the analysis and visualize the results.

## Dependencies
